LatLong is an application to convert addresses into Geographic coordinates and also convert the coordinates to addresses.
FEATURES:<br>

This app gives the user 2 modes:
<br><br>
<b>Geocoding:</b> Allows you get geographic coordinates for any any address, city or country.
After a valid location is entered it shows the Complete address of the location, the latitude and longitude coordinates.
<br><br>
<b>Reverse Geocoding:</b> Convert the geographic coordinates(Latitude and Longitudes) into addresses. Just enter the longitude and latitudes and get the location addresses instantly. It approximates the nearest locations and displays the information.
<br><br>
So just choose the mode and get the geographic coordinates information instantly.
<br><br>
<b>How it works:</b> This web application uses jQuery, JSON, and Google GeoCode API to get the Address Coordinates. The query if valid returns number of results with link and coordinates. App also allows you to reverse geocode the longitude and latitude values to give you the address suggestions returned by the Google geocode API.
